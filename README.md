Architecture is a library that makes scaffolding and file manipulation easy. It gives you a programatic interface and DSL for creating, copying, moving, "rendering", & deleting files and directories.

Architecture's main goal is to become the library of choice for gems like rake and thor.


Using
=====

Using the DSL you can:

``` ruby
require "architecture/dsl"

include Architecture

architecture source: "old", destination: "new"  do |arc|
  # Filesystem transactions here, see below
end
```

**Copy Operation**

``` ruby
# Copy a file OR directory:
arc.copy file: "README.md"
arc.copy directory: "docs"

# Copy over a file OR directory with a new name:
arc.copy file: "LICENSE", as: "COPYRIGHT"
arc.copy directory: "test", as: "spec"

# Copy over a file with context:
arc.copy file: "app.rb", context: { module: "Foobar" }

#> old/application.rb
# module {{module}}
#
# end
#
#> new/application.rb
# module Foobar
#
# end
```


**Create Operation**

``` ruby
# Create a file OR directory in the destination:
arc.create file: "app.rb"
arc.create directory: "lib"

# Create a file with content in the destination:
arc.create file: "app.rb", content: "Some thing."

# Create a file with some embedded context in the destination:
arc.create file: "app.rb", content: "Some {{foo}}.", context: { foo: "thing." }

# Create a directory in the destination and work within it:
arc.create directory: "lib" do |arc|
  arc.create file: "project.rb"
end

# Create a file OR directory in a specific location:
arc.create file: "dev.txt", location: "/var/logs"
arc.create directory: "output/", location: arc.join(arc.source, "tmp")
```


**Delete Operation**

``` ruby
# Delete a file or directory in the destination:
arc.delete file: "app.rb"
arc.delete directory: "app"

# Delete a file OR directory in a specific directory:
arc.delete file: "dev.txt", location: "/var/logs"
arc.delete directory: "output/", location: arc.join(arc.source, "tmp")
```


**Move Operation**

``` ruby
# Move a file or directory:
arc.move file: "app.rb", as: "app.rb"
arc.move directory: "app.rb", as: "app.rb"
```


**Overwrite Operation**

``` ruby
# Write over a file:
arc.overwrite file: "app.rb", content: "\n"

# Overwrite content in a file in a specific directory:
arc.overwrite file: "dev.txt", content: "\n", location: "/var/logs"
arc.overwrite file: "dev.txt", content: "\n", location: arc.join(arc.source, "logs")
```


**Append Operation**

``` ruby
arc.append file: "app.rb", content: "end"

# Append content in a file in a specific directory:
arc.append file: "dev.txt", content: "+", location: "/var/logs"
arc.append file: "dev.txt", content: "+", location: arc.join(arc.source, "logs")
```


**Prepend Operation**

``` ruby
arc.prepend file: "app.rb", content: "class Foobaz"

# Prepend content in a file in a specific directory:
arc.prepend file: "dev.txt", content: "-", location: "/var/logs"
arc.prepend file: "dev.txt", content: "-", location: arc.join(arc.source, "logs")
```


**Replace Operation**

``` ruby
arc.replace file: "app.rb", search: /Foobaz/, content: "Foobar"

# Replace content in a file in a specific directory:
arc.replace file: "dev.txt", search: /a/, content: "b", location: "/var/logs"
arc.replace file: "dev.txt", search: /a/, content: "b", location: arc.join(arc.source, "logs")
```


**Within Scope**

``` ruby
arc.within directory: "folder" do |arc|
  arc.create name: "version.rb", content: "VERSION = 1.0.0"
end

arc.within source: "/var", destination: "/tmp" do |arc|
  arc.create name: "version.rb", content: "VERSION = 1.0.0"
end
```
